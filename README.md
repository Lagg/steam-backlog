## Backlagg ##

This is a partial prototype I wrote as a tool to help me generate an outline of what games I may want to play next in my steam backlog and games I should
consider revisiting. Currently scrapes times from howlongtobeat.com, which I feel terrible about but don't really have any other choice at the moment.
Will probably reimplement when time permits as something more formal. Does the job for now though and might for someone else too.
